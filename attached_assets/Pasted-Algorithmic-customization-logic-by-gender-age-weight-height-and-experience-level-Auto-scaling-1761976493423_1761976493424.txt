Algorithmic customization logic (by gender, age, weight, height, and experience level).
Auto-scaling weekly training plan (progressive mileage and intensity).
Integrated meal plan builder (macros, daily menus, and hydration).
🧠 Step 1. Personalization Algorithm (Inputs → Outputs)
Inputs
{
  gender: "male" | "female",
  age: 25,
  height: 180, // cm
  weight: 75, // kg
  level: "beginner" | "intermediate" | "advanced",
  goal: "finish" | "performance"
}
Derived Metrics
const bmi = weight / ((height / 100) ** 2);
const bmr =
  gender === "male"
    ? 10 * weight + 6.25 * height - 5 * age + 5
    : 10 * weight + 6.25 * height - 5 * age - 161;

const tdee = bmr * (level === "beginner" ? 1.4 : level === "advanced" ? 1.8 : 1.6);
Training Variables
Level	Base Weekly Mileage	Long-Run %	Speed Work %	Recovery Focus
Beginner	15 mi → 35 mi	40%	10%	High
Intermediate	25 → 45 mi	35%	15%	Moderate
Advanced	35 → 60 mi	30%	20%	Low
🏃‍♀️ Step 2. Marathon Training Generator
Each plan uses 4 phases (Base → Endurance → Speed → Taper).
You can generate dynamic mileage using this schema:
function generateMarathonPlan(user) {
  const { gender, age, height, weight, level } = user;
  const baseMileage = level === "beginner" ? 15 : level === "advanced" ? 35 : 25;
  const longRunPct = level === "beginner" ? 0.4 : level === "advanced" ? 0.3 : 0.35;
  const plan = [];

  for (let week = 1; week <= 16; week++) {
    const mileage = baseMileage + week * (level === "advanced" ? 2.5 : 1.5);
    const longRun = Math.round(mileage * longRunPct);
    const tempo = Math.round(mileage * 0.2);
    const intervals = level === "advanced" ? 1 : week > 8 ? 1 : 0;

    plan.push({
      week,
      totalMileage: mileage,
      longRun,
      workouts: [
        { day: "Mon", type: "Rest" },
        { day: "Tue", type: "Easy Run", miles: mileage * 0.25 },
        { day: "Wed", type: "Strength/Core" },
        { day: "Thu", type: "Tempo Run", miles: tempo },
        { day: "Fri", type: intervals ? "Speed Work" : "Cross Train" },
        { day: "Sat", type: "Long Run", miles: longRun },
        { day: "Sun", type: "Recovery", miles: 3 }
      ]
    });
  }
  return plan;
}
This dynamically scales mileage and intensity based on user profile.
🍽️ Step 3. Smart Meal Plan Generator
Macro Split by Goal
Goal	Carbs	Protein	Fat
Finish (General)	55%	20%	25%
Performance	60%	25%	15%
Daily calories = TDEE + (100–300 extra during long runs)
Example: Daily Menus by Level & Gender
Beginner – Female (150 lb / 68 kg)
≈ 2,000 kcal, 55% C / 20% P / 25% F
Meal	Foods	Notes
Breakfast	Oatmeal + berries + almonds + Greek yogurt	Slow carbs & protein
Snack	Banana + peanut butter	Potassium + healthy fat
Lunch	Grilled chicken + quinoa + steamed veggies	Balanced macros
Snack	Protein shake + apple	Muscle recovery
Dinner	Baked salmon + brown rice + broccoli	Omega-3s + complex carbs
Intermediate – Male (180 lb / 82 kg)
≈ 2,800 kcal, 55% C / 25% P / 20% F
Meal	Foods
Breakfast	Scrambled eggs, whole-grain toast, avocado, fruit
Snack	Greek yogurt + granola
Lunch	Turkey wrap + sweet potato + spinach salad
Snack	Trail mix or protein bar
Dinner	Lean beef stir-fry + brown rice + veggies
Advanced – Performance (any gender)
≈ 3,200 kcal, 60% C / 25% P / 15% F
Meal	Foods
Breakfast	Overnight oats + whey protein + banana
Snack	Electrolyte drink + mixed nuts
Lunch	Chicken breast + pasta + tomato sauce + olive oil
Snack	Smoothie (banana, spinach, berries, protein)
Dinner	Salmon + roasted potatoes + asparagus
Pre-race Carb-Load	Bagel + peanut butter + sports drink
Hydration & Supplement Guidance
Hydration: 30–40 ml water per kg body weight daily.
Electrolytes: During runs > 90 min.
Optional: BCAA during long runs, iron & vitamin D for female athletes.
🧩 Step 4. Integration into Whole Fitness App
